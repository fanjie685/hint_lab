## Introduction
My name is Chen Xiahua, and I come from Nantong, Jiangsu. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Network Engineering from Nantong University in 2021. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Shanghai University, under the supervision of Professor Hao Wang. I am involved in research related to visual-enhanced NLP document understanding.

## Research Area
My research primarily focuses on key information extraction and generation for visually-rich documents. Specifically, my personal research direction involves multi-modal cues based visual-rich document information extraction. I aim to develop a unified document modeling approach that combines text, position, and image modalities. I have submitted papers to top-tier conferences in this field. In the future, I plan to align my research with large-scale models like ChatGPT to investigate the multi-modal capabilities of text-based models, such as two-dimensional positional perception and document generation abilities.

## Education
- Bachelor's Degree: Nantong University, major in Network Engineering, 2016-2020
- Master's Degree: Shanghai University, School of Computer Engineering and Science, 2021-present

## Work Experience
- Jan 2022: Algorithm Engineer Intern, 1-data Technology, Shanghai

    *Developed and deployed a visual-rich document information extraction model*
    
    I worked on a project that involved extracting key-value pairs from scanned documents such as waybills, receipts, and resumes, and saving them in JSON format. My responsibilities included data processing and analysis, debugging and development of the main model. I also used FastAPI to deploy the model quickly on Linux servers and wrote a DockerFile to generate Docker images as backups. The final key-value recognition accuracy exceeded 90%, meeting the company's business requirements.
