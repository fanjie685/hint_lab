## Introduction
I graduated from China University of Petroleum (Beijing) with a major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Shanghai University, enrolled in the class of 2022, under the supervision of Dr. Hao Wang.

## Research Topic
I mainly focus on document understanding tasks with a research emphasis on reinforcement learning. Specifically, I design a reward-driven reinforcement learning approach that enables intelligent agents to extract relevant features from the environment efficiently. This approach aims to address the sequencing issues in document understanding tasks more effectively.

## Education Background
- Bachelor's Degree: China University of Petroleum (Beijing), major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, 2018-2022
- Master's Degree: Shanghai University, School of Computer Engineering and Science, 2022-present

## Interests and Hobbies
I have a strong interest in playing table tennis, running, binge-watching TV shows, and exploring new technologies.

## Future Plan
I hope to complete all the necessary experiments smoothly during the next semester of my research program and successfully publish a paper in my second year. As for my career direction, I'm interested in either full-stack development or specializing in C++.
